Custom lighting effects for CoolerMaster MasterKeys

## What?
This is a small executable with a command line style interface with some custom lighting effects for the CoolerMaster MasterKeys Pro S. It supports all other MasterKeys keyboard as well, but I haven't bothered adding then yet.

In the future it will (probably) be a lightweight daemon instead, that is controlled from a separate program.

## Why?
Because the multilayer effect that comes with the standard software is not multiple stackable layers.
It should be named "multizones".

I wanted to combine the Single Key effect with the Color Wave effect, but that isn't possible. So instead I did this.

Also, it's really cool.
